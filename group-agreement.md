#Communication plan: 
Everyone will communicate in person and on slack throughout the day, and will be on campus at least from 9am-5pm, but we agree to re-assess as needed.

Interrupting each other is okay, just say sorry and make sure each person gets a chance to speak.

#Conflict plan: 
No one will raise their voice to another teammate. If their is an issue, they will speak to that person directly and privately. If the issue can not be resolved that way, a mediator will be brought in.

#Work plan: 
We will use the khan-ban project board.

#Git process: 
We will have a Github admin and a heroku admin. They will be the only person that can merge to master.
